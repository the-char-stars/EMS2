---

This is the Software Quality Term project for the __INFO2180__ Course at Conestoga College.

The due date is __December 10th, 2018__. 

## Contribution Breakdown
The work will be shared within the group of 4 as follows:

Author | Library Name | Github Account
-------- | -------- | --------
Divyang Dankhara | Demographics | @DivyangDankhara
Tudor Lupu | UI | @yuute
Attila Katona | Billing | @charStarGoulash
Alex Kozak | FileIO, Logging. Scheduling | @PossiblyKozak
 
 ## Project Purpose
 The purpose of this course is __not__ entirely about the programming aspect of this assignment, but rather the development of project management skills in a controlled group setting. That being said, the project will also focus on completing tasks and coming up with a final project in which to present as the culmination of the class itself. 
 
 With regards to the language and choices made, this project was intentionally done with the a couple of aspects restiricted. This restriction mostly had to do with the user interface portion and the database backend of the system. The UI is required to be a console based application, and the hard storage for the information is to be done using a flat-file database, barring the use of platforms like MYSQL or the like. 
 
 ## Tools Used
 There are a number of tools used throughout the project in order to make the project management run as smoothly as possible. They are as follows:
  - Pivotal Tracker
  - Microsoft Project
  - Git Repositories
  - Microsoft Visio/LucidChart
  - Doxygen commenting
  - Visual Stuido Integrated Unit Testing Services
 
 ## Brief Description
  Here is a short excerpt from the project specifications outlining the overview of the project. The document in its entirity can be found in the __/Docs__ folder of the repository:

 > The heart of this project is the development of an Electronic Medical System (EMS).  This system will be capable of registering patients, booking appointments and generating billing information for a typical medical clinic in Ontario. Your work is considered a prototype, to help determine the feasibility and core issues of developing a deeper solution for the huge, multinational Omnicorp Corporation

 > Ideally, this EMS would have a very nice and robust GUI frontend as well as a flexible and well-designed DBase backend – but to not lose the point of this project, your task for this project will be to generate the core logic for the EMS.  This core logic will be developed in C#, be a console front end (yes that’s right – a console) and use a flat-file for its persistent data storage.
